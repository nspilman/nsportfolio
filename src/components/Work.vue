									<h2>Work</h2>
									<p>Full Stack Developer<br />
									with background in Project Management</p>
								</header>
								<p>While working as an Implementation Project Manager at Epic, Nate developed a deep interest in software development itself. It began with "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python", and soon Nate was using Python to compare large data sets, manage database tables in sqlite3, and distributing information. </p>
								<p>Nate soon picked up a remote pro-bono full stack development position with Arts on the Hudson, a Jersey City, NJ based arts non-profit. Nate spent nights and weekends learning Django and the ins and outs of web host, transitioning the Arts on the Hudson website from Wix to Django, developing the whole site from scratch.</p>
								<p>Back at Epic, Nate was offered an opportunity to build and maintain and internal data management web portal. Nate quickly learned the basics of C# ASP.NET, MS SQL Server and significantly honed his vanilla JS skills to support this portal, all while working with some fantastic people.  </p>
								<p>Nate recently moved to Seattle with his lovely fiancee, and is looking for a development position in the Seattle area.</p>
